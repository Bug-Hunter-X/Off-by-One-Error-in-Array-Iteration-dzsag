# Off-by-One Error in Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java that can lead to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The error occurs in a loop iterating over an array, where the loop condition includes an extra iteration beyond the valid index range of the array. The solution demonstrates how to correct the loop condition to avoid this error.
